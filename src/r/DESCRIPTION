Description: psychrolib is a library of functions to enable the calculation of
    psychrometric properties of moist and dry air. The library works in both
    metric (SI) and imperial (IP) systems of units. This is a port of the
    original python psychrolib library written by D. Meyer & D. Thevenard (see
    https://github.com/psychrometrics/psychrolib).
